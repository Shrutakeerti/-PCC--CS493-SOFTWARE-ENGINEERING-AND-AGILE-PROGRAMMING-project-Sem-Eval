Logistic Regression:

Suitable for binary classification problems.
Can be used for predicting the presence or absence of specific diseases based on input features.
Support Vector Machines (SVM):

Effective for both classification and regression tasks.
Particularly useful for tasks where the decision boundary is not linear.
Random Forest:

An ensemble learning method combining multiple decision trees.
Useful for classification and feature importance analysis.
Gradient Boosting Algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM):

Effective for boosting the performance of decision trees.
Particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.
Neural Networks:

Deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image data or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data.
Powerful for capturing complex patterns in data.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

Non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression.
Relies on the proximity of data points in feature space.
Naive Bayes:

Particularly useful for text-based medical data or situations where the features are conditionally independent.
Simple and computationally efficient.
Decision Trees:

Tree-like structures that recursively split the dataset based on feature values.
Provide interpretable decision rules.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):

A type of recurrent neural network suitable for handling sequential data.
Useful for time-series data, such as patient histories.
Gaussian Processes:

Suitable for regression tasks, especially when uncertainty estimation is crucial.
Useful for predicting continuous outcomes or estimating probabilities.
